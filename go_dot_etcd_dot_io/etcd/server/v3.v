(* Package main is a simple wrapper of the real etcd entrypoint package
   (located at go.etcd.io/etcd/etcdmain) to ensure that etcd is still
   "go getable"; e.g. `go get go.etcd.io/etcd` works as expected and
   builds a binary in $GOBIN/etcd

   This package should NOT be extended or modified in any way; to modify the
   etcd binary, work in the `go.etcd.io/etcd/etcdmain` package. *)
